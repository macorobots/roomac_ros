allow_unknown: false
# (bool, default: true)
# Specifies whether or not to allow the planner to create plans that traverse unknown space. NOTE: if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert all your unknown space to free space (which planner will then happily go right through).

default_tolerance: 0.005
#! IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE USED
# (double, default: 0.0)
# A tolerance on the goal point for the planner. The planner will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away.

visualize_potential: false
# (bool, default: false)
# Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed via a PointCloud2.

use_dijkstra: true
# (bool, default: true)
# If true, use dijkstra's algorithm. Otherwise, A*.

use_quadratic: false
# (bool, default: true)
# If true, use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation.

use_grid_path: false
# (bool, default: false)
# If true, create a path that follows the grid boundaries. Otherwise, use a gradient descent method.

old_navfn_behavior: false
# (bool, default: false)
# If for some reason, you want global_planner to exactly mirror the behavior of navfn, set this to true (and use the defaults for the other boolean parameters)

lethal_cost: 253
# (int, default: 253)
# Lethal Cost (dynamic reconfigure)

neutral_cost: 66
# (int, default: 50)
# Neutral Cost (dynamic reconfigure)

cost_factor: 0.55
# (double, default: 3.)
# Factor to multiply each cost from costmap by (dynamic reconfigure)

publish_potential: false
# (bool, default: true)
# Publish Potential Costmap (dynamic reconfigure)

orientation_mode: 1
# (int, default: 0)
# How to set the orientation of each point (None=0, Forward=1, Interpolate=2, ForwardThenInterpolate=3, Backward=4, Leftward=5, Rightward=6) (dynamic reconfigure)

orientation_window_size: 1
# (int, default: 1)
# What window to use to determine the orientation based on the position derivative specified by the orientation mode (dynamic reconfigure)

outline_map: true
# (bool, default: true)
# Outlines the global costmap with lethal obstacles. For the usage of a non static (rolling window) global costmap this needs to be set to false
